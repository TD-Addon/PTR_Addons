# PTR Addons

This repository contains MGE and Lua addons for individual PTR projects/provinces.
These addons should be shipped as optional components of a release.

**NB:** The OpenMW parts of this repository currently require 0.49 which hasn't released yet.
They should not be included in a release until OpenMW 0.49 is stable.

## Tamriel Rebuilt

Includes an MGE overrides file for distant land as well as an OpenMW plugin that does the same thing.
These files ensure constructable locations in TR show up properly in distant land.

Currently covers
- Firemoth + Sulfurwatch
- Khalaan
- Nav Andaram
- Omaynis, The Kwama's Scuttle
